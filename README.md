# MySQL Employee Tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker provies the user with a way to view, add, and remove employees, departments, and roles from their database. The bulk of the application is built using MySQL, to pull from a hard-coded database, along with Inquirer to provide the prompts. The prompts that the user is asked are easy to navigate, to provide a pleasant experience and minimal learning curve.

 ## Installation

 The Employee Tracker is installed by first cloning the repo from [Edibozu](https://github.com/Edibozu/note-taker-ep). Once cloned, it needs to be opened in VS Code and ran by opening the terminal. Run the command ```node index.js```, and the first set of prompts will appear. Depending on how the user answers, the application will do the rest.
